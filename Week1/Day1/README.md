# Day 1
# HTML Practice Tasks

This project contains two basic frontend tasks focused on HTML structure and content formatting.

## Task 1: 200+ HTML Tags Practice

The file `day1-html-practice.html` demonstrates the use of over 200 HTML tags. It includes multiple headings (h1â€“h6), paragraphs with dummy text, ordered and unordered lists with at least 20 list items, 10 anchor links, 5 placeholder images, a 3x3 table, a complete form with 5 inputs and labels, and repeated usage of div, span, header, nav, section, and footer elements.

## Task 2: Simple Resume (CV)

The resume is built using `index.html`, styled with `style.css`. It has structured sections like Summary, Education, Internship Experience, Projects, Certifications, and Skills. Lists are used to display skills and certifications, with proper semantic tags and a clean layout for easy readability.
